                    Unlike Roman theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely 
                    free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture 
                    from that of two theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters 
                    long, and 156 meters wide, with a base area of 24,000 square metres. The height 
                    of the outer wall is 48 meters. The perimeter originally measured 545 meters. 
                    The central arena is an oval 87 metres  long and 55 metres wide, 
                    surrounded by a wall 5 metres high, above which rose tiers of seating.

                    The pyramid of Cestius is a Roman Era pyramid in Rome, Italy, near the Porta San Paolo 
                    and the Protestant Cemetery. It was built as a tomb for Gaius Cestius, a member of the Epulones 
                    religious corporation. It stands at a fork between two ancient roads, the 
                    Via Ostiensis and another road that ran west to the Tiber along the approximate 
                    line of the modern Via Marmorata. Due to its incorporation into the city's 
                    fortifications, it is today one of the best-preserved ancient buildings in Rome.

                    The Catacombs of Rome are ancient catacombs, underground burial places in and around Rome,
                    of which there are at least forty, some rediscovered only in recent decades. 
                    Though most famous for Christian burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed 
                    together, Jews and also adherents of a variety of pagan Roman religions were buried 
                    in catacombs, beginning in the 2nd century AD, occasioned by the ancient Roman 
                    ban on burials within a city, and also as a response to overcrowding and shortage 
                    of land. The most extensive and perhaps the best known is the Christian Catacomb 
                    of Callixtus located near the Park of the Caffarella, but there are other sites, 
                    both Christian and not, scattered around the city, some of which are now engulfed 
                    by modern urban sprawl.
